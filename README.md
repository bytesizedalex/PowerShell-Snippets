# PowerShell-Snippets
This repo contains PowerShell snippets, typically cmdlets with some Select-Object statements or custom functions. It will likely contain a mix with no specific focus and can act as a convenient location for code access on any device.

## Note

Many of these snippets are expected to be wrapped in other code or piped through export/out commands. They are often used in logging tools or troubleshooting capture scripts which export CSV or other file types full of information. This is why many have 'select' statements which define the output we want and the format we would like in these captures.
